----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------:

Embark on a brand new adventure with Shantae, the 
hair-whipping belly dancing genie.

When she loses her magic, Shantae must team up with her 
nemesis, the nefarious pirate Risky Boots in order to 
save Sequin Land from an evil curse. As a pirate, 
Shantae gains new weapons to advance her quest, slay 
monsters, battle epic bossesâ€¦and hopefully get her 
magic back in the bargain! But can she really trust her 
deadliest enemy?

The third Shantae game is the biggest yet! Beyond Sequin
Land lie cursed islands and labyrinths each hiding a new
piece of Pirate Gear - Flintlock Pistol, Pirate Hat, 
Scimitar, Risky's Boots, and even a Cannon. Upgrade 
Shantae's hair and weapons or unlock advanced Fighter's 
Moves. Locate maps, return lost Heart Squids, collect 
rare loot, and laugh out loud at the weird, wild, and 
wonderfully humorous cast of characters.

Incredible high resolution artwork, unlockable 
Pirate-Mode, multiple endings, and an unforgettable 
soundtrack make this one game you won't want to miss!
